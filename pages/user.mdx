# QuickJS

[QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) is a small and embeddable Javascript engine. It supports the ES2020 specification including modules, asynchronous generators, proxies and BigInt.

It supports mathematical extensions such as big decimal float float numbers (BigDecimal), big binary floating point numbers (BigFloat), and operator overloading.

OpenQuickJS is a community-driven fork of QuickJS. We welcome and encourage issues and pull requests from all users.

## Main Features

1. Small and easily embeddable: just a few C files, no external dependency, 210 KiB of x86 code for a simple “hello world” program.
2. Fast interpreter with very low startup time: runs the 69000 tests of the ECMAScript Test Suite2 in about 95 seconds on a single core of a desktop PC. The complete life cycle of a runtime instance completes in less than 300 microseconds.
3. Almost complete ES2020 support including modules, asynchronous generators and full Annex B support (legacy web compatibility). Many features from the upcoming ES2021 specification 3 are also supported.
4. Passes nearly 100% of the ECMAScript Test Suite tests when selecting the ES2020 features.
5. Compile Javascript sources to executables with no external dependency.
6. Garbage collection using reference counting (to reduce memory usage and have deterministic behavior) with cycle removal.
7. Mathematical extensions: BigDecimal, BigFloat, operator overloading, bigint mode, math mode.
8. Command line interpreter with contextual colorization and completion implemented in Javascript.
9. Small built-in standard library with C library wrappers.
