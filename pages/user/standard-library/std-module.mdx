# `std` module

The std module provides wrappers to the libc stdlib.h and stdio.h and a few other utilities.

Available exports:

## `exit(n)`

Exit the process.

## `evalScript(str, options = undefined)`

Evaluate the string str as a script (global eval). `options` is an optional object containing the following optional properties:

- `backtrace_barrier`: Boolean (default = false). If true, error backtraces do not list the stack frames below the evalScript.

## `loadScript(filename)`

Evaluate the file filename as a script (global eval).

## `loadFile(filename)`

Load the file filename and return it as a string assuming UTF-8 encoding. Return null in case of I/O error.

## `open(filename, flags, errorObj = undefined)`

Open a file (wrapper to the libc fopen()). Return the FILE object or null in case of I/O error. If `errorObj` is not undefined, set its `errno` property to the error code or to 0 if no error occured.

## `popen(command, flags, errorObj = undefined)`

Open a process by creating a pipe (wrapper to the libc popen()). Return the FILE object or null in case of I/O error. If `errorObj` is not undefined, set its `errno` property to the error code or to 0 if no error occured.

## `fdopen(fd, flags, errorObj = undefined)`

Open a file from a file handle (wrapper to the libc fdopen()). Return the FILE object or null in case of I/O error. If `errorObj` is not undefined, set its `errno` property to the error code or to 0 if no error occured.

## `tmpfile(errorObj = undefined)`

Open a temporary file. Return the FILE object or null in case of I/O error. If `errorObj` is not undefined, set its `errno` property to the error code or to 0 if no error occured.

## `puts(str)`

Equivalent to std.out.puts(str).

## `printf(fmt, ...args)`

Equivalent to std.out.printf(fmt, ...args).

## `sprintf(fmt, ...args)`

Equivalent to the libc sprintf().

## `in, out, err`

Wrappers to the libc file stdin, stdout, stderr.

- SEEK_SET
- SEEK_CUR
- SEEK_END

Constants for `seek()`.

## `Error`

Enumeration object containing the integer value of common errors (additional error codes may be defined):

- EINVAL
- EIO
- EACCES
- EEXIST
- ENOSPC
- ENOSYS
- EBUSY
- ENOENT
- EPERM
- EPIPE

## `strerror(errno)`

Return a string that describes the error errno.

## `gc()`

Manually invoke the cycle removal algorithm. The cycle removal algorithm is automatically started when needed, so this function is useful in case of specific memory constraints or for testing.

## `getenv(name)`

Return the value of the environment variable name or undefined if it is not defined.

## `setenv(name,` value)

Set the value of the environment variable name to the string value.

## `unsetenv(name)`

Delete the environment variable name.

## `getenviron()`

Return an object containing the environment variables as key-value pairs.

## `urlGet(url, options = undefined)`

Download url using the curl command line utility. `options` is an optional object containing the following optional properties:

- `binary`: Boolean (default = false). If true, the response is an ArrayBuffer instead of a string. When a string is returned, the data is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.
- `full`: Boolean (default = false). If true, return an object contains the properties `response` (response content), `responseHeaders` (headers separated by CRLF), `status` (status code). `response` is null in case of protocol or network error. If `full` is false, only the response is returned if the status is between 200 and 299. Otherwise null is returned.

## `parseExtJSON(str)`

Parse str using a superset of `JSON.parse`. The following extensions are accepted:

- Single line and multiline comments
- Unquoted properties (ASCII-only Javascript identifiers)
- Trailing comma in array and object definitions
- Single quoted strings
- \f and \v are accepted as space characters
- Leading plus in numbers
- Octal (0o prefix) and hexadecimal (0x prefix) numbers

## `FILE` Prototype

### `close()`

Close the file. Return 0 if OK or -errno in case of I/O error.

### `puts(str)`

Outputs the string with the UTF-8 encoding.

### `printf(fmt,` ...args)

Formatted printf. The same formats as the standard C library printf are supported. Integer format types (e.g. %d) truncate the Numbers or BigInts to 32 bits. Use the `l` modifier (e.g. %ld) to truncate to 64 bits.

### `flush()`

Flush the buffered file.

### `seek(offset, whence)`

Seek to a given file position (`whence` is std.SEEK\_\*). `offset` can be a number or a bigint. Return 0 if OK or -errno in case of I/O error.

### `tell()`

Return the current file position.

### `tello()`

Return the current file position as a bigint.

### `eof()`

Return true if end of file.

### `fileno()`

Return the associated OS handle.

### `error()`

Return true if there was an error.

### `clearerr()`

Clear the error indication.

### `read(buffer, position, length)`

Read `length` bytes from the file to the ArrayBuffer `buffer` at byte position `position` (wrapper to the libc fread).

### `write(buffer, position, length)`

Write `length` bytes to the file from the ArrayBuffer `buffer` at byte position `position` (wrapper to the libc fwrite).

### `getline()`

Return the next line from the file, assuming UTF-8 encoding, excluding the trailing line feed.

### `readAsString(max_size = undefined)`

Read `max_size` bytes from the file and return them as a string assuming UTF-8 encoding. If `max_size` is not present, the file is read up to its end.

### `getByte()`

Return the next byte from the file. Return -1 if the end of file is reached.

### `putByte(c)`

Write one byte to the file.
